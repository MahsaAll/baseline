This folder contains the input network data for the baseline scenario.

You can download the standard inputs from this shared folder: https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/tORm2rup7nZlkna

Alternatively, if you prefer to have your customised inputs, you can run the [network generation](https://github.com/matsim-melbourne/network) algorithm with your desired adjustments first and use the outputs of those algorithms as the input here.
