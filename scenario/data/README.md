## MATSim Melbourne baseline model inputs

This folder contains the input data for the MATSim Melbourne baseline model.

In order to keep this repository lean, these large files are not stored under version control.

Run the demand and network generation algorithms first and put their outputs (`network.xml` and `plan.xml`) in this directory as the input for the baseline scenario.
